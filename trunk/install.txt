How to install Library
=============================

Library is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete
/library folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as
administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Library icon in the list of
uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll
be ready to go.

The module is designed to be zero configuration; you can start publishing publications immediately
on install, though of course you will probably want to customise the collections to suit
your own purpose.
